# Data-analysis
In this data analysis project I applied some concepts I learned in statistics course on cars dataset.
I created the dataset by collecting the cars data from sahibinden website.
I applied statistics concepts such as Normality tests, ANOVA test, hypothesis tests, nonparametric test, Goodness of fit tests and visualization.
Also I applied machine learning by using linear regression model.
